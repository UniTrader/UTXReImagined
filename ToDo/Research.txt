How Research is planned to work:

=> IMPORTANT: There will be no Tech Tree, because thats imo too difficult to manage and to code a good order/research selection for the AI.
    the Technology will progress linear in Tech Levels (meaning everything is getting better).
    To add variation not everything is getting better at the same speed, though - everything will have a "golden time" where it is imba overpowered
    and have a Black Day where it is simply not worth the Money. Example:
      Plasma JET/LR Turrets getting HUGE Boost in Shield Damage one Day, so much that nothing stands in their way
      1 or 2 Days later the Shields and other Weapons will get an even bigger Boost in their Stats which makes the Plasma JET/LR less useful than it was before in comparision
      about 3 more days later the relative Stats of the most recent Tech are at original levels again (but compared to 5 Days before everything is about 3 times as powerful)

=> there will be multiple Research Stations in the Universe for the following Faction Groups:
  -> Albion PMC:
    PMC (0)
    Beryll (0)
    Ledda (-1)
    ...
  -> Albion HoA:
    HoA (0)
    ...
  -> Albion General (average or max between PMC and HoA; no actual research Station):
    ...

  -> DeVries:
    Cantera (0)
    Reiver (-2; Pirates)
  
  -> Omicron Lyrae:
    argon Government (0)
    JSS (0)
    ... 
  -> Maelstrom Split
    familyryak (0)

  -> Teladi
    Teladi Union (0)
  
  -> Xenon (diffrent research Method)
    Branch 9 (0)

=> the Factions used Tech is based on the Progress of their respective Research Station (number in Paranthesis above is difference to main Tech Level)
  -> the nearer they are to their Technological Leader/Researcher Faction the better Tech they get
  -> Pirates steal local Tech or use used, so they mostly have outdated Tech, but some may be lucky to get cutting edge Tech (number in Paranthesis is their minimum)
  -> Difference in DV for Pirates is low because Cantera has near to zero means to protect their Technology

=> Xenon have completely diffrent method of "research"
  -> they earn Research Points by Destroying Ships in their respective Zones and by getting their Ships Destroyed
    (see it as learning for them)
  -> for peaceful Traders this means they will at some point cease to be a threat
  -> for aggressive Fighters they will at some Point be the worst Enemy you could imagine
    > adds a new Gameplay Goal: how far can you push the Xenon Tech Level above the general Tech Level before they simply overrun the Universe with no resistance?
  -> balance Goal is to keep them at current Tech Level for an average Gameplay Style (some Trading, some Fighting, some Building)

=> Research should be balanced in such a way that the Progress is 1 Tech Level per InGame-Day
  -> each Research Station should need about 20h to produce the necesary Tech Points to advance a Level if Tech Level is roughly in Sync with IG-Days
  -> the remaining 4h is for the Player to accelerate a Groups Progress and to balance out Production Stops because of Ressources
  -> if Tech Level is not in Sync with IG-Days the necesary Research Points to advance may be modified
      (closer to 24h Production time if advanced, closer to 12h production time if behind schedule)
