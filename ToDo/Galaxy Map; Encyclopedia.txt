=> in Galaxy Map add shortvariations of Zone Names to the Map to replace the Numbers currently used
=> In Encyclopedia add Descriptions for Zones 
  -> if there is a Landmark there simply copy it with slight changes
  -> In case of no Landmark think of some short Story how the Zone Name could have been established
    > it is also fine to slightly change it, but the general meaning should remain
      example: Rat Fish Waters -> Rat Fish Lakes
  -> If something else fits its also fine, just fill that empty Encyclopedia Page with something ;)

=> Changes in the Vanilla Map to make it more attractive
  -> the Tubes will be changed slightly to fulfill the following criteria:
    > to get from any Zone to any Zone in the same Sector you dont have to enter more than 2 or 3 Tubes for the shortest route
    > no circling the whole Sector if you want to go some Zones back on the Tube Route
    > i will not introduce bi-directional routes per se 
      (i like the mono-directional character of the existing tubes, but the path of many of them can be improved)
    > remove sharp turns in the Tubes/make them smoother
  -> Add some new Sectors in the existing Galaxy where there is an Awesome Background
    > currently implemented are Behind Rupture and Old Omicron Yards (latter one is not in a releasable state yet)
    > Tube Layout will follow the criteria above from the very beginning

=> Re-Balancing of Map Parameters and re-distribution of Regions
  -> Regions shall be independent of Zones and usually cover more than one Zone
  -> also add "hidden" Regions with plenty Ressources but not nearby any Zone
  -> each Region shall only cover one Ressource
  -> if more than one Ressource is desired to be available in a Zone/Area make overlapping Regions
