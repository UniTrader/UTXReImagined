=> Basic Cargo is divided in multiple Space classes:

 -> XS, S and M are static - all three are universal and pretty small
  > each will have 3 size classes to accomodate for diffrent Ship types (except XS, which has only 1)
  
 -> L and XL are more interesting:
  >Depending on Vanilla Cargobay the Ships will have more or less specialized Cargobays:
   -Universal (1.00)
   -Cargo Class Specialized (~1.4) / Ware Class Specialized (~2.0)
    ->Liquid (2.0/3.0) ->Bulk(1.5/2.3) ->Energy(1.4/2.0) ->Container(1.3/1.7)

   -Ware Type Specialized (~2.0)
   Number in () is a multiplier compared to the Universal Cargo - more specialized Cargo Bays can take more Stuff
  >Cargobays can only specialized to things they already include
    (Universal can be converted to everything;
     Energy can only converted to Stuff which has the Energy Cargo Class, not eg Bulk)
  >one Exception: Energy may also be converted to a specialized Fuel Cargo Bay
    (but neither Universal nor Energy may Transport Fuelcells)
    - capacity multiplier does not apply in this case though - Fuel Cargobay is limited to 0,6*Universal Volume for safety reasons
    
 -> exact volumes still need to be determined

Universal: 50K
Liquid:   100K / 150K
Bulk:      75K / 115K
Energy:    70K / 100K
Container: 65K /  85K
