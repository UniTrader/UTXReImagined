*** closely related to Research, but not the same ***

=> There are 3 sizes of Slots on a Ship which can be equipped with diffrent Weapon Systems
	-> talk with the a Shipdealer or the respective Engineer to set up the intended loadout (and Logos)
		> when satisfied the Ship will fly to a Shipyard to apply the changes
		> can also use another Ship as Template as long as it is not outdated
		> Shipdealer only offers things which are available locally, and the requests will be fulfilled as far as possible
		  (when requesting to equip OL weapons in Albion the lelated Slots will remain empty)
	-> small Slots are for Shieldgens and small Turrets
		> some Slots are for Shieldgens only (at least one per Group) so you can always equip some
	-> medium Slots are, of course, for medium turrets
	-> big Slots are for Drone Bays or Big Turrets
		> number of them will be increased, but drone capacity of Drone Bays will be reduced to encourage building more of them
		> the alternative Big Turrets require HUGE amounts of Energy (see point Energy Points here) and therefore may not be a viable alternative to the energy-friendly Drone Bays
	-> Engines can of course be swapped (with varing color, used Tech and Tech Data)
		> combinations of these are pre-definied so you have to make a choice between favorite color or preffered tech Data)
		> will have slow Tech Progress
		> Engines are location-specific so you may have to travel far to get your preffered variant
		> also their Boosters are swap-able, where each has a diffrent priority
			(still have to look up whats possible there)
	-> there is also a choice between diffrent Jumpdrive Variants:
		Military
		Fast Travel
		Energy Save
		default
	-> Radar System is also swappable
		> all Cap Ships will have 3: Main, Backup (both swapable) and fallback (value-wise the worst, but can neither be swapped nor destroyed)
		> Backup Radar is not necesary to save some Energy
		> Energy demand grow expotentially with Range
	-> Ships with Universal get swapable Cargo
		> per default its a small Universal
		> can be swapped into a specialized Cargo with about 200% Capacity of Universal (Cargo Class restricted)
		> or into a highly-specialized Cargo with about 300% Capacity of Universal (Ware Type restricted)
	-> Ships with specialized Cargo can be changed into highly-specialized (Ware Type restricted) for 50% more Space

=> each Faction Group will have their own, unique Weapon Systems, but some will be shared across all Groups (some Factions may have their own variant, though)
	-> shared between all Factions:
		> Mining Lasers (NOT the upgraded non-mining Variant)
		> HIT/MAs
		
	-> Albion/PMC:
		> Plasma JET/LR
		
	-> Albion/HoA:
		
	-> DeVries:
		
	-> Omicron:
		> Upgraded Mining Laser suited for Battle (appears at T007)
		
	-> Family Ryak:
		> Hailstorm Turrets
		
	-> Xenon use a completely seperate Set of Weapons
	
=> Balancing of Upgrades is done via Energy Points
	-> each Ship Type has a certain amount of these - exact value depends on tech Level at buying/upgrading Time
	-> each swappable System is assigned such a Value, too
	-> both values will always increase with progressing Tech Level

=> there will be some special kind of Tuner Shop which moves across the Universe
	-> offers latest Tech of all Factions except Xenon
	-> also has special Engines available (multiple diffrent colors, Stats are the same for all, but top notch - although EXPENSIVE)
	-> when finished tuning one Ship will move somewhere else, so you have to look for him again when tuning the next Ship
