Goals of this XRebirth Mod:

=> Complete Re-Balancing of all Game Aspects
 -> especially Combat will see a thourough Re-Balancing through the introduction of Research/Technology
 
=> Introduction of actual Research/Technological Progress by (ab)using Dynamic Ship Loadouts
 -> will be implemented over multiple Stages to reduce the amount of Work per Step:
   > first Step is a Technological advance for all Factions every InGame-Day, although depending on Faction sometimes older Tech will be used (Cantera; Pirates)
   > second Step is to add actual Research: there will be Research Stations (Factories, which consume wares and produce the non-tradeable Ware Tech Points) to regulate Technological Progress
   > third Step is to seperate this Progress for Faction Groups: Albion (PMC); Albion (HoA); Cantera; Omicron; Teladi; Xenon
    - Tech Level of Pirates is determined by the general Tech Level of their Region - they are 2 - 5 below that usually
    - Similiar for the other Factions of Albion (neither PMC nor HoA) - they are about 1-3 below average or the Faction they are more aligned with (eg Berryl <> PMC)
    - Also Similiar for Omicron: non-Tech or Government Factions are a few levels below the Tech Leaders (JSS, Argongovernment)
    - Xenon Tech is determined completely diffrent: They gain their Tech Points by Killing Enemies or being Killed in their Territory
       if you leave them alone they wont grow, if you constantly battle them they may outperform all other factions combined in a short time

=> Faction Logo Mod will be Integrated here because otherwise it would conflict with the Dynamic Ship Loadout/Research Part
  -> will be modified/changed from the original, though: Logo Change will only be possible in Shipyards, although you may still talk with the Engineer to change the Logo (change will be applied on next SY visit)
  -> also it will be an aspect of re-balancing the boarding: all Factions allied to the previous Owner will attack a boarded Ship until you can get rid of the Original Logo on the Hull in a Friendly Shipyard not allied with the previous Owner

=> Boardcomputer will speak all new Stuff by using TTS
  -> maybe a re-voicing of all BC stuff for consistency?
