==> Omicron Superyards:
   -> Basic layout for DV Shipyard Module
   -> more Modules
      -> L/XL Yards - DONE (needs refinement)
      -> S/M Yards - DONE (needs refinement)
      -> Drone Facs - DONE
      -> Fuel Cell Fabs
      -> Production for base building functionalits - WiP
      
   -> Masstraffic
      > Add special Jobs for there which include Welder Drones
   -> Gate from Omicron Superyards to Commerce Core throws out in the wrong direction
      -> same for the local Gates
   -> Plot for this Sector is also planned



==> Behind Rupture
   -> last refinements
      > Increase Albion Jobs to account for an Additional Sector
      > Improve Pirate Station (remove Rocks; change Type to something more Piratey)
      > change directions for Pit-Tube a bit to avoit this weird twist
      > check if everything works as intended


Idea List for Omicron Superyards Plot:

=> For the 3-Split Part when 2 of them are finished start a Xenon Invasion on the Shipyard
=> Blow up the Engines while Boosting at some point ( Hilo Ho - give him some Credit :D )
=> to hire Teladi get more than 3 times your current Money (1, 3, 10, 30, 100 + Million, Billion, Trillion, Quadrillion...)
