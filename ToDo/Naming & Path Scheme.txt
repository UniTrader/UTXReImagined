General:
=> Rules apply of course only for Stuff which can be named freely, not e.g. the diff files in the Libraries-Folder


Naming of Files, components and macros:
 1) all Files for New Stuff must be prefixed with "xri_"
 2) if the File is generated automatically, but not inside a folder for those (eg script files) a "g_" follows
 3) then follows a Naming like EGO does it, but
 4) the exact identifier must identify whats in there without having to look it up
 example:
 XR-Original:
 units_size_xl_capital_destroyer_2_macro
 XRI-Copy of it:
|-1-||---- 3 -----||- 4 -||- 3 -|
 xri_units_size_xl_taranis_macro


File Paths:
 assets Folder:
 -> Automatically Generated Content from Balancing files goes to
    assets/generated
    regardless of whats inside

 -> New Files follow the same Rules as EGO, with one change:
    component.xml files go to a "components" folder, similiar to the macros
    model Data Folders go to a "models" folder, also like the macros

 -> Diff files to EGO files have to be put where their Original File is of course

 other Stuff:
  -> substitute Stuff for EGO files goes to the "subst_01"-folder if we ever need it (the floor here will kill you, try to avoid it!)
  -> balancing Template files from which many Mod Files are generated (or modified) go to "templates"
  -> in tools there are the xsl templates, script files and other stuff necesary for generating the Mod Content from balancing templates or spoken text from language files


Variable Names (md&aiscripts):
-> Global, md and Blackpoard Variables shall be prefixed with "xri_" - the rest is up to the scripter
